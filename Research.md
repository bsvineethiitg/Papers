### Capsule Networks 
1. Hinton's ideas on Capsules (IJCAI 1981!) - http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/object-based81.pdf 
2. Dynamic Routing Between Capsules (NIPS 2017) - http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6975-dynamic-routing-between-capsules.pdf
3. Matrix Capsules with EM Routing (ICLR 2018) - https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HJWLfGWRb
4. Transforming Auto-encoders https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/transauto6.pdf
5. Recent video by Hinton including the EM Routing paper https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5Vxk9twXlE 
6. Stacked Capsule Autoencoders https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.06818.pdf (Unsupervised learning) -> Geoff Hinton mentioned in a tweet that this is so far the best version of Capsules out there. (Dynamic Routing < EM Routing < Stacked Capsule Autoencoders). Relevant blogpost: http://akosiorek.github.io/ml/2019/06/23/stacked_capsule_autoencoders.html

### Temporary Memory (Fast Weights)
1. Hinton and Plaut, 1987, Using Fast Weights to Deblur Old Memories. https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7257/eacd80458e70c74494eb1b6759b52ff21399.pdf
2. Jimmy Ba's extensive 20 min talk on Fast-Weights at NIPS -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd20zGKAdoI
3. Schmidhuber's 1993, Reducing the Ratio Between Learning Complexity and Number of Time Varying Variables in Fully Recurrent Nets, ftp://ftp.idsia.ch/pub/juergen/ratio.pdf
4. Recent NIPS Publication by Hinton and Ba. https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6057-using-fast-weights-to-attend-to-the-recent-past.pdf
5. Hinton, Michael Zhang, Ba's Lookahead Optimizer connection to Fast Weights: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.08610.pdf

### Optimization
1. K-FAC: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.05671.pdf

### Temporary Memory (Memory Networks and others)
1. Weston, Chopra and Bordes. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.3916.pdf
2. Fast-weights like associative memory using Meta-Learning. The weights change as a function of the input at inference additively to the learned static weights. https://eccv2018.org/openaccess/content_ECCV_2018/papers/Damien_Teney_Visual_Question_Answering_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf

### Neuroscience Papers (e.g. Hebbian Synapses, Plasticity, etc)
1. Check references of (Hinton & Plaut, 1987, Fast-weights paper). 
2. Neuroscience Online TextBook - https://nba.uth.tmc.edu/neuroscience/toc.htm 

### Playing with the Loss function and Weight space
1. Model-agnostic Meta Learning (ICML 2017) - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03400.pdf
